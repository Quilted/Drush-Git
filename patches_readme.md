## Example

- fitvids-conflicts-with-ckeditor-2078821-4.patch
  - Added Nov 21, 2013.
  - See issue #2078821.
  - Problem: fitvids.js conflicts with ckeditor.js causing all ckeditor-enabled textareas to be hidden and not visible.
  - Patch: Workaround solution that only renders fitvids.js when ckeditor.js is not expected to be rendered. Not a final solution.
